2656. Maximum Sum With Exactly K Elements 

You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums and an integer k. Your task is to perform the following operation exactly k times in order to maximize your score:

Select an element m from nums.
Remove the selected element m from the array.
Add a new element with a value of m + 1 to the array.
Increase your score by m.
Return the maximum score you can achieve after performing the operation exactly k times.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 3
Output: 18
Explanation: We need to choose exactly 3 elements from nums to maximize the sum.
For the first iteration, we choose 5. Then sum is 5 and nums = [1,2,3,4,6]
For the second iteration, we choose 6. Then sum is 5 + 6 and nums = [1,2,3,4,7]
For the third iteration, we choose 7. Then sum is 5 + 6 + 7 = 18 and nums = [1,2,3,4,8]
So, we will return 18.
It can be proven, that 18 is the maximum answer that we can achieve.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [5,5,5], k = 2
Output: 11
Explanation: We need to choose exactly 2 elements from nums to maximize the sum.
For the first iteration, we choose 5. Then sum is 5 and nums = [5,5,6]
For the second iteration, we choose 6. Then sum is 5 + 6 = 11 and nums = [5,5,7]
So, we will return 11.
It can be proven, that 11 is the maximum answer that we can achieve.
